# Digital-Clock
Using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript

Clocks can be used in sites where time is the main concern like
some booking sites or some app showing arriving times of train,
buses, flights, etc. Clock is basically of two types, Analog and
Digital. We will be looking at making a digital one.

Approach: The approach is to use the date object to get time on
every second and then re-rendering time on the browser using
the new time that we got by calling the same function each
second.
